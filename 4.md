- The constraints above here are for the inflow and outflow for each node which has to be of degree 1.

- When we solve the above LP, this will lead to multiple subtours.

- Our aim is to find the shortest tour that covers all the cities. 

- So, in order to eliminate the subtours we introduce another constraint so that we get only one tour â€“ the shortest one, for our problem.
