Given the cities and the distances between them, what is the shortest possible route that visits 
each city exactly once and returns back to the origin city.
</p>

<p>
It is an NP-Hard problem.<b> Why? </b>
</p>

<p>
If the number of cities are too big then the computation of the shortest route is a complex problem even for the computers.
