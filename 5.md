<b>SUBTOUR ELIMINATION</b>

- There are two ways to implement subtour elimination.

- <b>Miller Tucker Zemlin subtour elimination(MTZ)</b>

 
  - This constraint ensures only one single shortest tour is generated. <b>How?</b>

  - Consider a cycle that goes from some node 4 to 5,
 U4–U5+ n X4,5 ≤ n-1 ⇒ U5 ≥ U4+ 1 
U has to increase by 1 along each edge of the cycle that does not include vertex 1.
